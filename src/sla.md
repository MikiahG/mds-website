# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

*Effective: {{ site.year }}*
# Introduction
This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the terms and conditions governing the services provided by Maple Data Services (MDS), specifically focusing on Storage, Virtualization, and Availability. MDS is committed to ensuring high availability and reliability of its services while maintaining transparency with its clients regarding maintenance periods and unexpected downtime.

# Availability Commitment
MDS implements a 3 tier approach for availability
## Normal operations
MDS aims for maximum uptime for its services. The standard availability commitment is 99.99% per calendar month (also known as "four nines"), meaning that downtime should not exceed a total of approximately 5 minutes in a given month.
#### Scheduled Maintenance:
MDS will schedule maintenance activities during low-usage periods and publish any planned maintenance windows at least 48 hours in advance. Any changes to these schedules will also be communicated with the same advanced notice.

#### Unexpected Downtime:
If unplanned downtime occurs, an automated system will notify affected users within one hour if they have enrolled in this service notification feature.
MDS will work to bring the service up as quickly as possible. If the services are down for a period greater than 3 days the case will be moved to the degraded service category

## Degraded services
If unplanned downtime happens MDS will strive to reestablish service within 1 week providing details to customers on the timeline of service restoration

If the services are down for more than 7 calendar days you as the user are eligible to apply for your money back. Restitution will be granted up to the entirely of a value of a month 
If service cannot be restored the case will be moved to catastrophic failure.
## Catastrophic failure 
MDS will take appropriate cautions to avoid catastrophic failures if possible. Understand that no matter the precautions taken no one can perfectly protect and house data. If a catastrophic failures were to take place MDS would take reasonable actions to restore data if possible. Understand that MDS is not infallible. If you value your data always have a backup in another location.
